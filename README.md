# Fling
Have you ever missed the simplicity of an USB Stick when sharing data over the
net?

Zero-friction sharing is a surprisingly unsolved problem. There's no reasonably
ubiquitous solution installed on everybody's machine. Online providers are often
packed with features, but miss out on things like direct download urls, a space
for others to easily _upload_ to you, or require registration from all
participants. I don't remember any of these things being a problem with USB ðŸ¤”.

Fling is a self-hosted file share. It is simple like USB without missing out on
the good parts of the web:
- Drop files on a fling and share the URL. That's it. The fling way of life.

Other features include:
- Choose your own, meaningful name for your sharing URL
- Share a direct download link
- Choose to let others upload files just as simple
- Protect your fling by a password - no registration required
- Let a fling expire after a date or a number of clicks (or keep it forever)

# Fling is a API
It gets even better!

Fling is a backend service and a web interface. But you can use anything else
that speaks HTTP if you prefer. In fact, we generate and publish a javascript
and python client for the Fling API on every build. If you like it bare-bones
there is also a querysheet in the examples folder with raw HTTP calls.

Fling also has a code-first OpenAPI compliant spec. O mon Dieu, it just checks
_all_ the boxes!

# Fling as a container
It gets even even better better!

Fling is self-hosted. But it is packaged up in a docker container for easy
deployment. Run `docker run --rm -p3000:3000 arminfriedl/fling` and go to
http://localhost:3000. Admin user is `adminName:adminPassword`.
